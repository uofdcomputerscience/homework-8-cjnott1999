U of D Mobile Development Homework 8

This is either the easiest or most difficult homework yet.

For this homework assignment, I need you to describe your intended final project to me. Include any intended data sources, sketches, and ask questions if needed.


For this project, I will be building an app to assist people who are descendants of Italian immigrants claim their right to citizenship Jure Sanguinis. The app will deterime if the person is eligible, determine their consular jurisdiction, and then assist with the documents they need. It will also provide news from the Italian Senate (Senato della repubblica) in both Italian and English. I would like to experiment with localizations as well so that the app can be viewed in both English and Italian.
